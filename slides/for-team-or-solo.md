##  For Team or Solo

When Kelly uses Blocks, he likes to see the whole team's blockers. It looks like a heatmap. He can see if others are having process problems or time problems. He can see how long the stress has been going on for and he can even sort the blockers by the tickets they've been tagged to.

Mark uses Blocks but he doesn't want others to know what he's tracking. So he just keeps it disconnected from Pivotal Tracker.
