<h2>The Good Engineer</h2>

<img src="images/128.jpg" alt="">

<p>Mark works at a small-sized company that makes educational game software. He is the lead developer and he has a great team of talented developers. He uses Pivotal Tracker but if he wants to look at another developer's performance, he just looks at the commit history.</p>

<p>He's happy with his CEO, CTO, Product Owner. He'd like to make a little more money but he knows that he's lucky to be where he's at.</p>
