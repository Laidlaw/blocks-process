<h2>Agile Problems</h2>

<p>In order to have a meeting, engineers have to switch context from the code they're working in, to a different set of complexities.</p>
<p>Engineers are constantly solving problems and if something comes up that they can't immediately fix, that memory will quickly be overwritten more pertinent details. This is much the problems that don't have words or tickets attached to them.</p>
<p>These could be very important problems, but they aren't stored anywhere.</p>
