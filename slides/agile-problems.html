<h3>Meetings are Context Switches</h3>
<br>
<p>When you switch context, you lose resolution.</p>
<p>Engineers are constantly thinking. If an observation comes up that they can't immediately fix, that observation will get lost in the flood of thoughts.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>These observations could be critical to future performance, just not directly applicable.</strong></p>
